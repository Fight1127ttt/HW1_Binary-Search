# Binary-Search

## What is a binary search

A binary search algorithm is used to find the position of a specific value contained in a sorted array. 
Working with the principle of divide and conquer, this search algorithm can be quite fast, but the caveat is that the data has to be in a sorted form. 
It works by starting the search in the middle of the array and working going down the first lower or upper half of the sequence. 
If the median value is lower than the target value, that means that the search needs to go higher.
If not, then it needs to look on the descending portion of the array.
